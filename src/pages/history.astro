        Circassians, also called Cherkess or Adyghe (Adyghe and Kabardian:
        Адыгэхэр, romanized: Adygekher), are an indigenous Northwest Caucasian
        ethnic group and a nation; native to the historical country-region of
        Circassia in the North Caucasus. As a consequence of the Circassian
        genocide perpetrated by the Russian Empire in the 19th century during
        the Russo-Circassian War, most Circassians were exiled from their
        homeland in Circassia to modern-day Turkey and the rest of the Middle
        East, where most of them are today. In the early 1990s, the
        Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization estimated that there are
        as many as 3.7 million Circassians in diaspora in over 50 countries.

      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Circassians mainly speak the Circassian languages, two mutually
        intelligible languages of the Northwest Caucasian language family,
        namely Adyghe (West Circassian) and Kabardian (East Adyghe). Adyghe is
        based on Temirgoy (Chemirgoy) dialect, while Kabardian is based on the
        dialect of the same name. Circassians also speak Russian, Turkish,
        English, Arabic, and Hebrew in large numbers, having been exiled by
        Russia to lands of the Ottoman Empire, where the majority of them live
        today, and some to neighboring Persia, to which they came primarily
        through mass deportations by the Safavids and Qajars or, to a lesser
        extent, as muhajirs in the 19th century.
