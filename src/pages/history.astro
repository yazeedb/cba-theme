          Circassians, also called Cherkess or Adyghe (Adyghe and Kabardian:
          Адыгэхэр, romanized: Adygekher), are an indigenous Northwest Caucasian
          ethnic group and a nation; native to the historical country-region of
          Circassia in the North Caucasus. As a consequence of the Circassian
          genocide perpetrated by the Russian Empire in the 19th century during
          the Russo-Circassian War, most Circassians were exiled from their
          homeland in Circassia to modern-day Turkey and the rest of the Middle
          East, where most of them are today. In the early 1990s, the
          Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization estimated that there
          are as many as 3.7 million Circassians in diaspora in over 50
          countries.

          Circassians mainly speak the Circassian languages, two mutually
          intelligible languages of the Northwest Caucasian language family,
          namely Adyghe (West Circassian) and Kabardian (East Adyghe). Adyghe is
          based on Temirgoy (Chemirgoy) dialect, while Kabardian is based on the
          dialect of the same name. Circassians also speak Russian, Turkish,
          English, Arabic, and Hebrew in large numbers, having been exiled by
          Russia to lands of the Ottoman Empire, where the majority of them live
          today, and some to neighboring Persia, to which they came primarily
          through mass deportations by the Safavids and Qajars or, to a lesser
          extent, as muhajirs in the 19th century.
